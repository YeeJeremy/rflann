Description: Basic R interface for the FLANN C++ library written by Marius Muja and David Lowe.
             This package was written primarily for another package, 'rcss'. This packages utilises
             a few features from the FLANN C++ library. When I have time (and if there is sufficient
             demand), I will add more functions.
